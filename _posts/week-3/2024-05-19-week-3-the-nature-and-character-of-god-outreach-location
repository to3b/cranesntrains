こんにちは！We’ve finished week 3! This was our first week of “normal” lectures. We listened to the lectures on base (where we live), but starting week 4 we should be at the building YWAM OSAKA have been renovating. It’s a 5-10 minute walk from the base. Our speaker for this week was Eric Williamson, he spoke on ‘the character and nature of God.’ It was a good week of classes! 

I was happy we were learning on base because I’ve been recovering from a cold. Almost fully recovered now!

We have lectures from Monday to Thursday, then Friday we have our track (art, sports, general) lessons. 

During this week, we also found out where we are going for Outreach! The Philippines (Tacloban City and Manilla) and Japan! For 7 weeks we’ll be in the Philippines, and the rest of Outreach will be in Japan! 

This Friday after track lessons, we went to a park in Takatsuki to hang out and play volleyball. That was fun! 

On the weekend, I did some shopping and had my first proper Maccas experience. Saturday night, I cooked dinner with Yayoi (Japanese DTS student) and we ate together with Akiyoshi (Yayoi’s husband, also a DTS student). It was yummy! Then Sunday, Eliannah, Hana (the girls in my room) and I went to the International Baptist Church in Takatsuki, ate lunch together, and then got drinks from a cafe in the train station. It was raining today, so we brought umbrellas! 

It’s been a good week settling into the base, and I’m looking forward to next week - ‘hearing God’s voice’!


Praise:

- Settling into the base nicely 
- Learning new things about where I live
- Building good relationships with the people on base and in the community 

Prayer requests:

- That I fully recover from a cold
- For Outreach to the Philippines and Japan - that we learn things that will be helpful for Outreach phase
- Continue to build relationships with the Japanese community here - we have a family/community night on Wednesday for dinner (A great opportunity to connect with the Japanese people)
