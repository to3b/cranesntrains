こんにちは！We have finished week 6 (Biblical Worldview) now! Our speaker for this week was Mike Heath. I really enjoyed the lectures and Discovery Bible Studies which we can use while we are on outreach in the Philippines. We will also get to see Mike and some of his family in the Philippines for the YWAM All Together conference. 

This week went so fast! Most of the photos I took were of what we did on the weekend! On Saturday, the DTS students and a few staff went to Hirakata park - a theme park with lots of rides! My favourite was the water slide one! Yayoi san and Akiyoshi san took photos of us all riding it :). Then in the evening we celebrated Adam’s (James’) birthday by going out for dinner (hot pot) in Takatsuki, and then going to karaoke! It was nice spending most of the day with everyone! This was my first karaoke experience, and I thought it was fun. Then Sunday morning, we went to church and had pizza for lunch! I took a photo of Madelyn (my one-on-one/mentor) setting up the tables outside. I love her! 

One of the key prayer points would be relationships with the Japanese community! Please pray that we make great connections with the local Japanese and that our outreach Friday afternoons at Takatsuki park would be effective in us making friends here. This week Friday, we made 2 Japanese friends through Volleyball, and they both seem interested in coming to our Community Night Wednesday. And we also met an Australian lady from Melbourne who lives in Takatsuki! So I hope we can meet her again. 

Next week the topic is ‘Relationships’ - our speaker is from Brisbane! I’m looking forward to it! またね！
