こんにちは！This was our last week of Lecture Phase for DTS 2024! We had Greg Lilley, the base director of YWAM Niseko in Hokkaido (Japan), teach on ‘the Holy Spirit’. This was a great week to follow ‘Lordship’ week! Greg taught us about the Holy Spirit through telling us his story and through practical application during lectures, e.g. we would pray for each other and Outreach locations and listen for what God was saying for them - it was similar to ‘Hearing God’s voice’ week. Greg also didn’t want us to set up tables and chairs for lectures, but instead sit on the couches and floor (sitting on the floor is a part of Japanese culture. All the lunch/dinner tables are low to the ground and we sit on the floor around them.) I enjoyed this week! And also enjoyed preparing for Outreach!
This week, the aircon in my room had been leaking, and so my roommates had to remove the carpet. So it was a bit difficult because we couldn’t sleep in that room! But we worked it out, and once we leave they will hopefully put the carpet back down once the room is dry. 
On the weekend, I found ‘Traditional Australian Meat Pie’ at a new local grocery store! So when I come back, and I’m missing an Aussie meal, I’ll have to get some! This grocery store has a few international foods, and it’s close to the base. 
Saturday night, Akiyoshi san, Yayoi san, and I had somen noodles for dinner together! It was delicious! I’m grateful for my Japanese family! 
So that’s it! Lecture Phase is complete! And now we are preparing for Outreach. We leave on Monday 22nd July for the Philippines. I really enjoyed Lecture Phase and I’m looking forward to Outreach!
Please be praying for us and the ministry we will do there. I believe we will do lots of children's and youth ministry in the Philippines and Japan. 

Time-outline:
Philippines Outreach - 7 weeks, 22nd July-8th September 
Kochi city, Japan - around 2 weeks after 8th September 
Then we graduate from YWAM DTS on the 2nd-4th of October! 

I won’t do any writing on Outreach, but I may afterwards. Thank you for your support! またね！
