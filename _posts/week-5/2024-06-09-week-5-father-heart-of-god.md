こんにちは！Week 5 is finished and we are now already finished with week 6…! It’s been quite busy here for DTS students, so I’m a bit behind on blog posts. 

Firstly, we had a fun talent show Sunday of week 5! My contribution was “fairy bread” as an Australian snack - but it was more like a Japanese version that tasted better with their bread and soft sprinkles. It looked pretty too! Other talents included yo-yoing, magic tricks, singing etc. 

The topic for this week was ‘Father heart of God,’ and our speakers were Les and Sandi H. It was a difficult week because we didn’t feel like we had much free time to reflect further on the topic. Some classes went over time and we had a few extra sessions too. It’s a big topic to put into one week - so I felt overwhelmed with all the information we were given. But it was a good topic to explore! 

On the weekend, (Saturday) I took the Takatsuki base bike (which had a flat tire that I attempted to inflate, but I think it had a hole in it… I still used it though! I tried to be extra careful!) to the grocery store. To use a shopping trolley here you get this little trolley and then put a shopping basket in it. So you can’t really do one big shop! Then Sunday Aika (one of the Japanese translators for DTS) invited us to a church she was going to. We left the base at 8:30am ish to get to the church at 10:30am - by train and bus. So it was a little far, but we all really liked the church. The church is called Minho International Church. They were excited that we came! And posted a photo of us on their church instagram. I was excited to go because they have lots of children and youth there, and they also have a youth group. 

Now on to week 6 - Biblical world view! またね！
