こんにちは！Week 4 of lectures is finished! This week our speaker was Stephen So from a YWAM base in Newport, South Korea. He taught us about ‘hearing God’s voice,’ and provided us practical homework each day: to prayer for others, ask God what is on His heart and what He would like to tell us. I really enjoyed listening to what Stephen had to say on this topic, and that he gave us practical applications that we can make into habits to grow our relationship with Jesus. The DTS students were also given chocolate for memorising Romans 3:22-24 ESV over this week. I chose to write down the verse on a card Yayoi (one of the Japanese DTS students. Her husband and her are like our Japanese parents at YWAM! Always taking care of us!) bought for me at a Christian store in Kyoto. I took this card on my walks around Kanmaki, and had it memorised by Thursday! I’m loving going on walks around Kanmaki! But it is a bit dangerous… The convenient stores are so close and so cheap… I might end up coming back to the base with lots of food!


Things that we did this week:

- We had lectures Monday to Thursday on ‘hearing God’s voice’ 
- On Friday, we had Art Track - we zoom called 2 Christian artists from different parts of the world (This is one of the artists website - https://www.kylart.ca/ - She illustrates children’s books for unreached kids, and at the moment she is working on a book for Cambodia). They talked about how they are using their gifting to honour God and reach people using art. In Art Track we also learnt about human anatomy and drawing people - I tried to practise this by drawing people from YWAM playing sports at the park.

- Also on Friday, a few DTS students went to a English cafe that is run by the International Baptist church I have been going to - I sat at the beginner table for learning English, and made new friends from Takatsuki! One of the friends we made came to church on Sunday too.)
- Before we went to the English cafe, all of the DTS students and staff went to a park in Takatsuki to play sports (Volleyball, soccer or rugby), draw, and make new friends - we asked 3 boys to play soccer with us and they joined our large circle to kick the soccer ball around. And we might see them again next week!

Praise!

- We can go help at the English cafe and make friends with people in Takatsuki. 
- I am almost fully recovered from sickness (only a bit of a cough)
- I’ve been having back issues, but recently it’s not been a problem! We do lots of walking here, so that’s been helping.

Prayer requests:

- That I and the DTS students learn lots about the Father heart of God next week (week 5) 
- Please pray for the speakers and translators that translate the message from English to Japanese everyday
- Our ministry here at base - Wednesday night community dinner, and going to the park every Friday. We want to build close relationships with the people in our community!

We have a talent show tonight (Sunday), and I’m planning on making Australian fairy bread from Japanese sprinkles and bread. It might look interesting! I’ll update you next week. 

During week 5 we will be learning about ‘the Father heart of God.’ So I’m looking forward to this week! 

またね！
