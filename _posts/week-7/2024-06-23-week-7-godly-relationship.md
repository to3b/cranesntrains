こんにちは! For week 7 we had Jenni Neibling from the YWAM base in Brisbane teaching on ‘Relationships.’ She was very straight forward and clear with her message, and she gave us small group opportunities to discuss what we were learning. I loved having a Aussie lady around and being able to relate with her.  To know God is to love and relate to people! We’ll get to see Jenni again in the Philippines for the YWAM All Together event. Yay! 

Last week, my friend Abbey also arrived from Brisbane YWAM to do her outreach part of DTS. So I got to visit her church Jesus Cafe House on Saturday! I was so excited to see her again!!

Last Sunday, Yayoi invited Joshua (DTS student from NSW), Jazon (DTS student from America) and I to Kunike’s house to make takotaki and okonomiyaki for dinner! Kunike comes to the base and helps Hana (one of the cooks on base, and also my roommate) with shopping and cooking sometimes. Yayoi and Akiyoshi live in Shiga prefecture and were able to use their car to take us to Kunie’s house. I’ve been wanting to learn how to cook Japanese food, so I really enjoyed the experience! I think the boys enjoyed making and eating the food too! Also, Kunie likes Tim Tams!!

We had some beautiful sunsets here last week! 

We had small groups at a cafe/restaurant for Anita’s birthday (a staff member)! 

We did portraiture in Art track, and Jake (DTS student from Canada) drew me. 

Our base’s monthly worship night was on Friday too. There were a lot of Japanese people that I hadn’t seen before there. 

As I’m writing this, I’m on the Shinkansen travelling to Saitama (near Tokyo) for a week of outreach to a Christian school. I’m super excited because I love youth! And I look forward to making good connections and sharing God’s love with the high school students.

So the topic for week 8 will be Evanglism - but we won’t be having lectures, instead we will be doing a mini outreach in Saitama (near Tokyo) at a Christian high school.
