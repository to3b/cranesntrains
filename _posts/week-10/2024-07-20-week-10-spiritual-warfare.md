こんにちは！For week 10, the topic was Spiritual Warfare. Our speakers were Anita, Len and
Nicky who all are missionaries here in Japan leading the YWAM Takatsuki base. We talked
about some of the strategies of the enemy, and different “battlefields” we fight in (mind, heart,
and mouth - I drew the icons Anita used) but also focused on the armour of God. One of my
takeaways from this week was that we don’t have to put on the armour of God every morning,
we never take it off. But we have the responsibility to maintain and look after our armour by
connecting with God.
We had our last immersive Japanese lesson for the DTS Lecture Phase. Nakahara sensei, our
teacher, made each of us a certificate saying we have completed his Japanese communication
course! Very sweet!
This week I did a few artsy things. In Art Track time, we painted mushrooms because they have
natural shapes and come in a range of colours. We went to the park Friday to play volleyball
and be out in the community of Takatsuki. Here I drew a few DTS students playing volleyball!
On Friday nights, Osaka International Baptist Church hosts a English Cafe and invite English
speakers to help out. After this Camila invited some of the Japanese ladies to dinner with us. I
think these three Japanese ladies are all interested in Christianity and want to learn more about
Jesus. I hope I can continue to be friends with them even after DTS! And that they come to
know Jesus personally.
On the weekend, some of the DTS girls went to a mall only a few train stops away from the
YWAM base. We had Korean food together for lunch! It was very hot outside, so I got noodles in
ice - they were interesting. Then on Sunday, all the YWAM base residents were invited to go to
Lake Biwa in the Shiga prefecture. This was so much fun and refreshing! But unfortunately a
few of us got sunburnt…
Next week, the topic is Lordship. I’m looking forward to this week! またね！
Prayer requests:
- Continuing to build the friendships I have made with Japanese people
