## YWAM updates!
# ABOUT ME
Konnichiwa! I’m Ebony, a 18 year old from South Australia. I love Jesus and Japan! Since I was 13 years old, I’ve wanted to spend my gap year in Japan, and when I was 15 years old, I decided I would do YWAM in Japan to pursue this dream and missions. So I finished school last year and applied to YWAM OSAKA in Takatsuki to do a Discipleship Training School for 6 months. Here I’ll share weekly updates! :)
